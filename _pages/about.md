Welcome! I am a BIDMaP Postdoctoral Research Fellow at UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. My research includes (1) Computational modeling of complex materials for energy storage applications; (2) Atomistic simulations with statistical mechanics & first-principles calculations; (3) AI for Science: machine learning interatomic potential, generative models, reaction networks development & applications.

I will be joining the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at National University of Singapore as an Assitant Professor in Summer 2025. I am looking for 1-2 PhD students [(openings)](http://zhongpc.github.io/files/NUS-hiring-PZ.pdf).

**Previously**: I obtained my Ph.D. in Materials Science from UC Berkeley in August 2023 and B.S. in Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2018.
