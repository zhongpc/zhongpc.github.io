<strong>PhD Students</strong>:

Interested in pursuing a PhD in science? We recommend that you watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUa5CQ0yE6c&t=794s">Seminar Talk</a> before application. 
The presentation from Prof. Silvija Gradecak is particularly useful. If you have a strong desire to pursue this path, please check the <a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/graduate/graduate-programmes-by-research/how-to-apply/">timeline</a> and submit your application in the GDA3 system.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">We are actively looking for PhD students</span>. Openings are available for both Fall and Spring intake.
* B.S. or M.S. in physics/chemistry/computer science/materials science or related fields
* TOEFL ≥ 90 or IELTS ≥ 6.5. GPA ≥ 80%. GRE is optional but preferred. 
* Please email (1) your CV and (2) a very short statement of research interests to <a href="mailto:am3grouphiring@gmail.com">am3grouphiring@gmail.com</a>.
* The PhD positions are well-funded in our group. We do not accept self-financed students (including CSC scholarships). 
* We always encourage excellent candidates to apply for <a href="https://nusgs.nus.edu.sg/scholarships/">PhD Fellowships</a>:

    * A*STAR Scholarship  <span style="color: lightgray">[with service commitments]</span>
    * AI Singapore Scholarship  <span style="color: lightgray">[with service commitments]</span>
    * President's Graduate Fellowship (<strong>PGF</strong>)  <span style="color: lightgray">[by nomination]</span>
* <strong>PGF</strong> can be submitted at any intake. Successful applicants usually have received PhD offers from US-Top20 institutions (or equivalent). Feel free to get in touch if you want to pursue a different journey at NUS.
* Research Assistant (RA) positions are provided as financial support for the PhD program. We do not offer standalone RA positions.

* What we offer:
    * We are a TechTeam-style group. We help each other and value direct communication.
    * We focus on both method development and applications. We maintain close collaborations with experimental researchers.
    * We encourage our graduate students to thrive in interdisciplinary research environments, find their interests, and develop their careers.
    * We are committed to fostering a positive and supportive research environment.
