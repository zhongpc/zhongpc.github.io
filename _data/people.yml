    bio: Yubai is a PhD candidate at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS). He is interested in ferroelectrics, and he prefers using computational methods to investigate the real microscopic physical process and properties of matter, such as machine learning assisted molecular dynamics. In his spare time, he is pursuing his goal of becoming a bodybuilder. He is not only inspired by the most novel and interesting research findings in the lab, but also motivated by the larger muscles in the gym!
    degree: "Visiting PhD student from UCAS (2025-2026)"
